# Freizeitpark - *amusement park*

The "Freizeitpark" is a Java program which simulates a visit to the amusement park. Just like in a real amusement park you have to buy an admission ticket. Then you can decide how long you stay in the amusement park and what activities you want to try out.

## Overview
+ **Ticket Purchase:**  Visitors can purchase tickets for adults, children (under 14 years), teenagers (between 14 and 18 years) and students with corresponding discounts.

+ **Activities:** Visitors can choose from various activities including buying ice cream, riding roller coasters, using the restroom, drinking alcohol (adults only), or strolling through the park.

+ **Time Tracking:** The program tracks the time spent by visitors in the park and updates it as they engage in different activities.

+ **Interactive Experience:** Visitors can interact with the program through a simple command-line interface.

## Challenges
Upon reviewing the code, it becomes evident that numerous lines are commented out. This occurred because I initially implemented the time-tracking function last, necessitating adjustments to other sections of the code to ensure seamless time tracking and enhance user-friendliness. Overall, the primary challenge I encountered was putting myself in the shoes of the end user and making the program more intuitive for them.

## Future Improvements
As my next semester begins next week and I have to learn two new programming languages before the end of next week, I'm uncertain if I'll have time to enhance this code. However, if time permits, I would like to explore how to position an image on the right side of the window. Furthermore, I aim to create a functional virtual clock to accurately display the time visitors spend in the park.
